## Local Development Setup

| Task                          | Command         |
| ----------------------------- | --------------- |
| Install deps                  | `npm install`   |
| Lint & format                 | `npm run lint`  |
| Compile TypeScript → `build/` | `npm run build` |
| Watch & re-build on save      | `npx tsc -w`    |

> **Testing in an app:**
>
> 1. From the library root run `npm pack` to create a tarball.<br>
> 2. In a sample Expo or React-Native app: `npm install <path-to-tarball>` and run the app with a development build (`eas build --profile development`).
